    As a media specialist, I have extensive experience with a variety of digital
    tools and platforms, and I love using these skills to push the boundaries of
    what is possible in the world of art.

    In my work, I strive to create immersive and engaging experiences that
    explore the potential of these exciting technologies. Whether I am creating
    a virtual reality installation or using AI to generate unique
    visualizations, my goal is always to push the boundaries of what is possible
    and to inspire others to do the same. Growing up, I was surrounded by a
    vibrant arts community and was constantly inspired by the creative energy of
    the city. I studied media and art in college and have been working as a
    media specialist for over 10 years.

    In recent years, I have been focusing on using webXR and AI to create
    interactive and engaging works of art. This technology allows me to create
    immersive experiences that truly captivate and engage my audience. Aside
    from my work as a media specialist, I am also a passionate artist who loves
    to explore new mediums and push the boundaries of traditional art forms.
